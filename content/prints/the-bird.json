    "description": "Little Bird in Forest, after we crashed under the bumper of our car while we were looking for a wild camp spot. We tried to get in a forest road and we hit our car, broke our washer fluid box. Then we immediately tried to get out to the main road. I was mad, exhausted and sad but also relaxed because something worse than this could've been happen.\n\nWe hit the road again and saw an amazing lake with a good landscape as usual in Norway. Somehow I wanted to park there, I will not lie, I was looking for a moose. We walked in the green, large forest by the lake. It was so quiet, I was thinking the bad luck will never leave me, but then this little, curious, cute creature started to playing around us. Literally, she was flying around us, looking at us and changing her place time by time. \n\nThis curiosity made my day. The nature always has something to surprise us in my opinion. I am really glad that I could capture this moment. This little bird told me: \"there is always a good thing even in a bad situation\"\n\nPlease handle the prints carefully since they are delicate fine art, borders of the print can be used to hold the paper safely. \n\nAll of my fine art prints are being printed on extra high quality paper, and carefully prepared for you.\n\nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach me! Looking forward to hear from you!",
