    "description": "An incredible view of blue iceberg creek. In our trip to Iceland, we wandered around in Glacier Lagoon and find out this incredible iceberg. Icebergs have this blue form under water but when it flips over the water, it keeps its blue color for several hours and then it becomes white again. So this is a quite good coincidence we got here!\n\nSupport my passion of photographing wildlife and nature by buying my prints.",
